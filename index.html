       <p> This was my first ever <u> real</u> concert. I had been to smaller music events before this, but nothing to this scale. I honestly don't remember much from it since it was 5 years ago, but I do remember I was right next to the stage! Fall Out Boy is a rock band, so it was a very loud concert and certainly overwhelming for my first concert. But I had so much fun! Fall Out Boy was my favorite band at the time, and I remember they had come to St Louis a little while back but I couldn't go, and I was very sad. But this concert was in Kansas City, and luckily my mom bought me tickets as a birthday present!  </p>

      <h1> Break </h1>
          <p> Due to COVID19, I did not go to any concerts in between 2019 and 2021. I even had plans to see BTS during this time, but they had to cancel their tour. &#x1F614; </p>

         <p>There is actually a funny story behind this concert. My favorite band is BTS, and I have been wanting to see them in concert for a while. Since no bands I like ever come to St Louis, my best friend who lives in Las Vegas was joking that BTS should come to Las Vegas. Vegas is basically my second home, since I go there all the time to visit my friend, so chances are I would be able to go to a BTS concert in Vegas. I then joked that we would get the best seats possible, not thinking either of these would happen. But lo and behold, a few months later, BTS announced a concert in Vegas! And by some miracle, I got the closest seats to the stage! I'm still not sure how this happened. I still consider this to be the best day of my life since I got to spend it with my best friend and I got to see my favorite band up close.  </p>

      <p> This was certainly the most <em>interesting</em> concerts out of all the ones I've been to. To start, it was a music festival. And not only that, it's one of the biggest festivals in the US. Now I had never been to a music festival before this, and I was going alone. I only went for one specific artist who wasn't performing until 10pm, so I didn't get there until 5pm or so. Considering I had never been to a music festivaal before and certainly not one this size, I told myself I was going to stay in the back to stay safe. But once I was there, I gained courage I didn't have before and pushed through the crowd. Granted, my view still wasn't great but it also wasn't the worst considering I got there so late. </p>

    <p> Once I was in the crowd, there was no going back. While I did have fun, I did not pack enough water and ended up getting dehydrated and almost passing out at one point. I think I'll stick to regular concerts from now on... &#x1F62C; </p>

      <p> This was by far the most eventful concert of all of them. It was my first time travelling completely alone, my first time camping, and my first time at a general admission concert. Let me start from the beginning. This concert took place in Chicago, so I had to ride the train up to Chicago and then use the public transport to get around, since I couldn't rent a car. This was all new and scary to me, but it surprisingly went well! Now this was a general admission concert, which basically means "first come first served" on getting a good spot. So I met up with some friends, and we pitched a tent outside of the arena to ensure we got a good spot. This luckily paid off! I ended up being #29 in line and got one of the best seats in the house. The artist even looked at me a few times! </p>

<p> While the concert itself was certainly an unforgettable experience, I also look back fondly on getting to spend time with friends while camping. I may have been super sore afterwards since one of my friends stole my blanket and i had to sleep on the hard ground, but it is still a funny story to look back on. I remember I slept over 15 hours when I got back from that trip. </p>

      <p>By this point, I didn't really listen to Fall Out Boy anymore. I still appreciated their music, but it wasn't a prominent part of my playlist anymore. But when I heard they were coming to St Louis and the cheapest tickets were $20, I couldn't pass up the chance. They were such a big part of my early teenage years and I knew they would still put on a amazing show. As expected, the show was amazing. It even got me back into their music! I added quite a few of their songs back into my playlist.  </p>
